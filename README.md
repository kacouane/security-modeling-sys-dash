## Requirements
We suggest you to create a separate virtual environment running Python 3 for this app, and install all of the required dependencies there. Run in Terminal/Command Prompt:

```

## What does this app show

Select using checkboxes or the dropdown some security techniques: magic happened and you can see several properties of the security system you've made.

These properties are computed from the main tab in center. You can change these in order to describe a protection of your's.

Then you can change the factor of cost and "attack easyness factor" that give you the ability to push forward protections against some specific attacks.

Below you have a 3D graph that represent several propositions next to yours. 

This chart is a result from a fuzzing campain and may not suggest the best solution for you! 
So to make theses propositions follow the rules you may have changed click the update button and wait.
